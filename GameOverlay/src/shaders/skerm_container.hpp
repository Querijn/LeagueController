    Overview:

        Shader program 'SkermContainer':
            Get shader desc: SkermContainer_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: SkermContainerVertex
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_SkermContainerVertex_vertexPosition = 0
                Uniform block 'SkermContainerVertexParams':
                    C struct: SkermContainerVertexParams_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_SkermContainerVertexParams = 0
            Fragment shader: SkermContainerFragment
                Uniform block 'SkermContainerFragmentParams':
                    C struct: SkermContainerFragmentParams_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_SkermContainerFragmentParams = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader SkermContainer = sg_make_shader(SkermContainer_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'SkermContainerVertex':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_SkermContainerVertex_vertexPosition] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'SkermContainerVertexParams':

        SkermContainerVertexParams_t SkermContainerVertexParams = {
            .mvp = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_SkermContainerVertexParams, &SG_RANGE(SkermContainerVertexParams));

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'SkermContainerFragmentParams':

        SkermContainerFragmentParams_t SkermContainerFragmentParams = {
            .color = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_SkermContainerFragmentParams, &SG_RANGE(SkermContainerFragmentParams));
