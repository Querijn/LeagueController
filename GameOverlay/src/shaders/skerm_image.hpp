    Overview:

        Shader program 'SkermImage':
            Get shader desc: SkermImage_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_vertexPosition = 0
                Uniform block 'SkermImageVertexParams':
                    C struct: SkermImageVertexParams_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_SkermImageVertexParams = 0
            Fragment shader: fs
                Uniform block 'SkermImageFragmentParams':
                    C struct: SkermImageFragmentParams_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_SkermImageFragmentParams = 0
                Image 'diffuse':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_diffuse = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader SkermImage = sg_make_shader(SkermImage_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_vertexPosition] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_diffuse = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'SkermImageVertexParams':

        SkermImageVertexParams_t SkermImageVertexParams = {
            .mvp = ...;
            .spriteExtents = ...;
            .pivot = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_SkermImageVertexParams, &SG_RANGE(SkermImageVertexParams));

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'SkermImageFragmentParams':

        SkermImageFragmentParams_t SkermImageFragmentParams = {
            .color = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_SkermImageFragmentParams, &SG_RANGE(SkermImageFragmentParams));
