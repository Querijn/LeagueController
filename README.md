Play League of Legends with your controller

This is the heavily redacted source of what I was working on some years ago, and it will no longer work even if I didn't redact it.

This is 100% use at your own risk. I am not available for support of any kind, it is here merely for educational purposes, and for those that have the will to try and get it working again.

The code might refer to "IssueOrder", I recommend not going down the path to recreate it. It used to have been built with a lot of investigation to ensure it doesn't ban accounts, and this information is not public and removed from the source code. Instead, emulate the mouse.
